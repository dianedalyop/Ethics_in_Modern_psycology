Ethics in Modern Psychology: The aim of this project is to present a balanced viewpoint on professional practice standards.
I am not a medical professional, and the perspectives shared here and in the accompanying video are based on academic research
and a review of various sources.

    <section id="modern">
        <h2>Modern Ethical Standards</h2>
        <p>Modern psychology ethics are guided by frameworks such as the APA's Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Informed consent</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw</li>
            <li>Protection from harm</li>
            <li>Confidentiality</li>
            <li>Debriefing after studies</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="freud">
        <h2>Ethical Issues in Freud's Work</h2>
        <p>Sigmund Freud's contributions to psychology are foundational, but many of his methods and practices raise significant ethical concerns when viewed through a modern lens.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of informed consent:</strong> Freud often examined patients, including children, without modern consent standards from them or their parents.</li>
            <li><strong>Patient confidentiality:</strong> Many of Freud’s case studies revealed identifiable personal information which would be a violation of modern ethical standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias and interpretation:</strong> Freud interpreted patient behavior through his own theoretical viewpoint, this raised ethical concerns about objectivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Therapist and patient boundaries:</strong> Freud’s relationships with patients blurred professional boundaries , in modern psycology Boundaries are one of the core pillars.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="adler">
        <h2>Ethical Issues in Adler's Work</h2>
        <p>Alfred Adler, founder of Individual Psychology, took a more socially-oriented and optimistic approach than Freud. However, some aspects of his work still bring up ethical considerations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early case documentation:</strong> Like many early psychologists, Adler did not follow modern standards for confidentiality when publishing case studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural assumptions:</strong> Some of Adler’s interpretations about social roles and "inferiority complexes" may appear overly generalized or culturally biased today.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of standardized methods:</strong> Adler’s therapeutic approach was more intuitive than empirical, raising concerns about reliability and patient protection.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

     <section id="cases">
        <h2>Historical Case Studies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Milgram Obedience Study</strong> – Ethical issues around stress, deception, and lack of consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Stanford Prison Experiment</strong> – Harm, power abuse, lack of oversight.</li>
            <li><strong>Little Albert</strong> – No informed consent, long-term harm, unethical conditioning of a child.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p> Importance of ethical awareness as psychology continues to evolve
             into the digital age, especially with AI, online therapy,
              and massive data collection.
            The Ethics Code is intended to provide guidance for psychologists 
            and standards of professional conduct that can be applied by 
            the APA and by other bodies that choose to adopt them.
             The Ethics Code is not intended to be a basis of civil liability. 
             Whether a psychologist has violated the Ethics Code standards does 
             not by itself determine whether the psychologist is legally liable in
              a court action, whether a contract is enforceable,
             or whether other legal consequences occur.</p>
