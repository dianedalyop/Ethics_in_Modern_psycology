        <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Ethics in Modern Psychology: The aim of this project is to present a balanced viewpoint on professional practice standards.
I am not a medical professional, and the perspectives shared here and in the accompanying video are based on academic research
and a review of various sources.

        <h2>Ethical Issues in Freud's Work</h2>
        <p>Sigmund Freud's contributions to psychology are foundational, but many of his methods and practices raise significant ethical concerns when viewed through a modern lens.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of informed consent:</strong> Freud often analyzed patients, including children, without modern consent standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Patient confidentiality:</strong> Many of Freud’s case studies revealed identifiable personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias and interpretation:</strong> Critics argue that Freud interpreted patient behavior through his own theoretical lens, raising ethical concerns about objectivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Therapist–patient boundaries:</strong> Freud’s relationships with patients blurred professional boundaries that today would be considered inappropriate.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="adler">
        <h2>Ethical Issues in Adler's Work</h2>
        <p>Alfred Adler, founder of Individual Psychology, took a more socially-oriented and optimistic approach than Freud. However, some aspects of his work still bring up ethical considerations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early case documentation:</strong> Like many early psychologists, Adler did not follow modern standards for confidentiality when publishing case studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural assumptions:</strong> Some of Adler’s interpretations about social roles and "inferiority complexes" may appear overly generalized or culturally biased today.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of standardized methods:</strong> Adler’s therapeutic approach was more intuitive than empirical, raising concerns about reliability and patient protection.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>


    <section id="cases">
        <h2>Historical Case Studies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Milgram Obedience Study</strong> – Ethical issues around stress, deception, and lack of consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Stanford Prison Experiment</strong> – Harm, power abuse, lack of oversight.</li>
            <li><strong>Little Albert</strong> – No informed consent, long-term harm, unethical conditioning of a child.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="modern">
        <h2>Modern Ethical Standards</h2>
        <p>Modern psychology ethics are guided by frameworks such as the APA's Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Informed consent</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw</li>
            <li>Protection from harm</li>
            <li>Confidentiality</li>
            <li>Debriefing after studies</li>
        </ul>
